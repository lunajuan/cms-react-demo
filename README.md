# Juan's React SandBoxes
This project's goal is to host live React code samples on [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io). Codesandbox allows you to [import github repos as "sandboxes"](https://codesandbox.io/docs/importing#import-from-github) which is a nice feature since I can develop locally and manage with git.

## Branches
Each `sandbox-*` branch represents a different sandbox. The `master` branch contains code shared by all sandbox branches.
